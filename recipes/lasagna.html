        <li>Make the meat sauce. Add beef and sausage to a large skillet over medium-high 
            heat, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the onion and garlic. Cook until 
            meat is browned, about 6-8 minutes. Drain the fat from the meat. Return the meat to 
            the skillet.</li>

            salt, 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon basil, and the black pepper. 
            Stir until well combined. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the sauce 
            for 30 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the minced parsley.</li>
        <li>As the sauce cooks, make the ricotta mixture. In a large bowl, add 1 cup 
            mozzarella, the ricotta, ¼ cup parmesan, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the egg, 
            1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and ½ teaspoon basil. Stir until 
            well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta al dente, according to it’s package directions.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna. In a 13x9 inch baking dish, add a very thin layer of meat 
            sauce (about ¼ cup). Layer 3 lasagna noodles, ⅓ of the ricotta mixture, and 1 ½ 
            (level) cups of meat sauce. Repeat the layers twice.</li>
        <li>Add a final layer of the remaining noodles, meat sauce, 1 cup mozzarella, and 
            ¼ cup parmesan.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Bake for 45 
            minutes. Remove the foil. Bake 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 15-20 minutes before cutting.</li>

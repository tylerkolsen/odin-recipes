        <p><h2>Home-made Spaghetti Sauce</h2></p>
        <p>Without a doubt, the sauce is king. No one wants to eat plain noodles, so why
            should you? With a few extra flourishes your sauce will transcend from ordinary
            to noteworthy.</p>
        <p>Despite its refined appearance, our sauce recipe is simple to make. We'll guide
            you every step of the way so that you can be the next topic of polite dinner
            conversation.</p>

        <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a 12-inch (and deep) skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add beef in crumbles, leaving space between them, and let sear on bottom until 
                golden brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then start crumbling beef and continue to cook, tossing and crumbling 
                occasionally until fully cooked through, about 3 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Transfer beef to a large plate lined with paper towels, leave 1 Tbsp 
                rendered fat in skillet (or add 1 Tbsp olive oil).</li>
            <li>Reduce skillet heat to medium, add onion and saute 4 minutes. Add 
                garlic saute 1 minute longer.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, water, tomatoes paste, cooked beef, basil 
                and oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
            <li>Bring to a light boil then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until 
                onions are tender, about 15 - 20 minutes.** Thin with a little more water 
                as needed (or thicken with a little more tomato paste as needed).</li>
            <li>Stir in parmesan. Serve warm with cooked spaghetti, garnish with more 
                parmesan and parsley.</li>

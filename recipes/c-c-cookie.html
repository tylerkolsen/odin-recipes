        <p><h2>Just like Mom's cookies</h2></p>
        <p>Think back to some of your favorite memories. Just mentioning chocolate chip
            cookies evokes soft morsels of steaming goodness coming out of your oven. Without
            a doubt these cookies will be a favorite of your family.</p>
        <p>This classic dessert has been done a million ways. Here we'll be focusing on a
            home-made feel that will have people asking for the recipe for years to come.</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>3 cups (380 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>2 sticks (227 grams) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature (67 F)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (247 grams) lightly packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 cups (340 grams) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter, granulated sugar, 
                and brown sugar until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and eggs. 
                Gradually beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>If time permits, wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 
                24 hours but no more than 72 hours. This allows the dough to “marinate” 
                and makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and more flavorful. Let dough sit 
                at room temperature just until it is soft enough to scoop.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a large cookie scoop 
                and drop onto prepared baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before 
                removing to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol></p>
